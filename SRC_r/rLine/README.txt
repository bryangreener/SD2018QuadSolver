 - rLiner.r
   rLiner is the user-prompted component of the qsolver. Essentially the function prompts the user for input values "a,b,c".
   This function breaks the input string into values a, b, and c. The function also converts these values to numeric. The 
   values are then wrapped in a values object in order to be referenced by the main function. 

 - src 
   Directory following "src" directory structure in root

Folder contents:

- a.out
  This file is the compiled project. Can be run within gdb.

- makefile

- obj

To compile:
  Run "make" from within the v0-2 directory. This generates a.out.
  To run fresh compile, first run "make clean" then run "make". This removes all
  generated object and dependency files.

  Run "gdb a.out" to start debugging of the compiled project.

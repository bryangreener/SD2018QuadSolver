The documentation folder should include the following items. If they do not
exist, then they are to be added as the project grows. In this case, not all of
these files are necessary due to this being an in class project and not
being an external, client facing project. Thus some items such as NDA and
License may not be needed.

- README
- Stories
- TPS Reports
- License
- NDA
- Programming Standards
- Version Control
- Automation
- IEEEfp Standards
- Quadratic Equations
- Report
- Maintainance/Install Docs
